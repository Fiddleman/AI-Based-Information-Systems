Hello! 

Thanks for your interest in my work and the topic *Artifical Intelligence in Information Systems*. In this repository you find my teaching and course material for the university course *AI Algorithms and Applications with Python*. Over the last years I have taught this course (or parts of it) at *Darmstadt University of Technology*. I try continuously to improve and update the material - so if you have any complaints, wishes, ideas or questions please feel free to contact me. If you are interested in general at data science and information systems you can also take a look at my other lectures (see <a href="https://github.com/dominikjung42?tab=repositories" target="_blank">here</a>).

The course itself is organised in the following units: 

ID | Unit
---- | -------------
1 | Introduction into Artificial Intelligence
2 | Problem-solving Agents
3 | Introduction into AI-Programming with Python
4 | Data and Knowledge Engineering
5 | Knowledge Representation - Fundamental Algorithms and Concepts
6 | Machine Learning - Fundamental Algorithms and Concepts
7 | Model Optimization and Selection
8 | Artifical Intelligence on Big Data 
9 | Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning
10 | Stochastic Modeling and Optimization
11 | Building Productive AI-based Information Systems

For each unit, you can find the accompanying material in the different folder of this repository. The best practice is that you clone this git repository (for more information see the slides of the first lecture)!

For my students, please note that:

* Exercises will deepen the contents of the lectures and address specific problems in more detail. Additionally, questions regarding the lectures can be resolved.
* Furthermore, guest lectures will provide insights into state-of-the-art application scenarios.
* Both, exercises and guest lectures are relevant and serve to prepare yourself for the exam.
* You can use previous exams from the *exams* folder to prepare yourself for the final course exam.

If you have further questions, you can contact me by mail (see lecture syllabus) or add a comment in the git repository. 

Have a nice day!

Dominik
