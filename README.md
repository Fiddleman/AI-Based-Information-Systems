# Course Material for 'Building AI-Based Information Systems with Python'
Hello! 

Thanks for your interest in my work and the topic *Artifical Intelligence in Information Systems*. In this repository you find my teaching and course material for the course *Building AI-Based Information Systems with Python*. Over the last years I have taught this course (or parts of it) at various universities and business schools such as *Darmstadt University of Technology*, or *Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)*, or the *HECTOR School of Engineering & Managementsupport*. I try continuously to improve and update the material - so if you have any complaints, wishes, ideas or questions please feel free to contact me. If you are interested in general at data science and information systems you can also take a look at my other lectures (see <a href="https://github.com/Fiddleman?tab=repositories" target="_blank">here</a>).

The course itself is organised in the following units: 

ID | Unit
---- | -------------
1 | Introduction into Artificial Intelligence
2 | Artifical Intelligence and Information Systems
3 | Artificial Intelligence Toolbox
4 | Data and Knowledge Engineering
5 | Fundamental Algorithms and Concepts
6 | Summary: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence
7 | Advanced Algorithms and Concepts
8 | Artifical Intelligence on Big Data 
9 | Fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks
10 | Advanced Concepts of Artificial Neural Networks
11 | Stochastic Modeling and Optimization
12 | Conclusion: Building AI-based Information Systems

For each unit, you can find the accompanying material in the different folder of this repository. The best practice is that you clone this git repository (for more information see the slides of the first lecture)!

For my students, please note that:

* Exercises will deepen the contents of the lectures and address specific problems in more detail. Additionally, questions regarding the lectures can be resolved.
* Furthermore, guest lectures will provide insights into state-of-the-art application scenarios.
* Both, exercises and guest lectures are relevant and serve to prepare yourself for the exam.
* You can use previous exams from the *exams* folder to prepare yourself for the final course exam.

If you have further questions, you can contact me by mail or add a comment in the git repository. 

Have a nice day!
